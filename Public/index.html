    <section class="biography">
        <p>I have always wanted to do nails since I was about 10 years old. 
            I would always go with my mom when she went to the salon to get 
            her nails done just to go watch. Even at my young age, I knew
            that I loved atmosphere, look and even the smell of a salon. 
            Fast forward to 2019, thats when I finally decided to get trained and 
            licensed as a nail technician. I was ready to have a job that 
            I would absolutely love and never dread getting up everyday for. 
            I have a wonderful, supportive husband. We have been married 
            for 10 years now. We have a cute, spunky 6 year old son that 
            keeps life busy and so fun!</p>
